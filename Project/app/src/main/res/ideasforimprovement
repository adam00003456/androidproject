1. Vibrations when hit by bullets.
2. Scrolling 2d background with more diverse enemies and bosses (possibly level editor)
3. Better collisions
4. Clean up code (structure,etc.)
5. After 4 bullets, 2 second cooldown (cant keep firing all the time). (Bullet delay)
6. Dynamic sizes and positions so it can fit on more android devices
7. Particle explosions
8. Light and day affects based off reading in data from day

MAKE SURE TO TURN ON BULLET COLLISIONS AGAIN!!
