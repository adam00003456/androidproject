Android Project Game

I wanted to run a fun experiement of which way is the best way to play a mobile game.  As a result, I created
a simple space shooter using no external graphic libraries in order to demo four ways of controllers:button,
touch/gesture, voice, and accelerometer.  Also, as a result of this experiement, I wanted to explore the different
sensors that are available on modern day smartphones and see how they work behind the scenes, codewise.  From my
experiment, I have found personally, I enjoyed the accelerometer and the touch/gesture controls the most because
the sensors used were the most unique to the smartphone.
